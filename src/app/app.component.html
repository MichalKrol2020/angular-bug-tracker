<!-- This router outlet is for authentication purposes
     There's only a Router Outlet in the app.component template
     because we want to set the main page corresponding to
     the authentication status:

     -if user is not logged in -> show login page
     -if user is logged in -> show dashboard component -->
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
